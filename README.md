# 3D-Printable Gripper

A simple and fun 3D-printable gripper that anyone can print, build, and use â€” no robotics skills needed.

## What's Included

- `worm_screw.stl`: The worm screw
- `toothed_wheel.stl`: The toothed wheel (print **3 times**)
- `base.stl`: The main base
- `rear_arm.stl`: The rear arm (print **3 times**)
- `jaw.stl`: The jaw (print **3 times**)
- `closing_part.stl`: The closing part
- `jaw_flexible_part.stl`: The jaw flexible part (print **3 times**)

## How to Use

1. Download the STL files.
2. Open them in your 3D slicer software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
3. Slice them and print on your 3D printer.
4. Assemble the parts.
5. and then use a motor which would be attached to the  bottom of the worm screw and the rotation would make the gripped work and then you are goof to go.
